# Journal of Open Data

Journal of Open Data is a platform that can be used by any data providers to publish the professionally archived and preserved data with some sample meta data along with other necessary parameters using a stable long living URL. The submission can be peer reviewed and verified and a DOI can be assigned to it. The same can be used for citation.
