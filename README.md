# Journal of Open Data

Journal of Open Data is a platform that can be used by any data providers to publish the professionally archived and preserved data with some sample meta data along with other necessary parameters using a stable long living URL. The submission can be peer reviewed and verified and a DOI can be assigned to it. The same can be used for citation.

To start the app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
